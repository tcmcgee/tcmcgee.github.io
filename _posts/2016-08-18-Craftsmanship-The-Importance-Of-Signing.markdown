# Code Signing

If you've been following my blog, you know I have been reading [Software Craftsmanship by Pete McBreen](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Imperative-Pete-McBreen/dp/0201733862), and one of the points he stresses throughout the book so far (I'm only on Chapter 9), is how a software Crafter handles taking ownership of their code. Pete says that a Crafter should always sign their code. What I think he means by this is leave a way for people to contact you. If you know every piece of code you've ever written could be traced back to you I think you would hold yourself to a higher standard. Do you really want `Tom McGee` to be the person that developers are cursing 10 years down the line because of the patchy work? Probably not. Now that Github and other version control systems are becoming more popular it's easy to assume that your code is always signed, but I doubt people really want to go searching back in a commit log with potentially thousands of commits just to find who added this one line of code. That's why I'm going to start trying to be more loud and proud (metaphorically of course) about any project I work on, and urge including a *Contact The Developers* portion at the bottom of any Readme that includes our names and emails. I want to know that any work I do, or any team that I work on is proud of the product that they are submitting, and I think code signing is an awesome way to hold developers accountable, in a world of tight deadlines and temptation to *just make it work*.
