title: Testing Improvements
---

After getting my tests looked at, it was pointed out to me that they're not very thorough and although they do all pass when the program is properly working, when they failed there was no easy way to tell exactly where the program was going wrong. My goal is to correct this and begin to add a lot more tests.<br> I began by revamping my computer_spec file, starting with a clear lack of tests for any board size greater than 3x3. I used essentially the same tests as my 3x3 modified for a 4x4 board and decided to use {% highlight ruby %} context "When board 4x4" {% endhighlight %}
