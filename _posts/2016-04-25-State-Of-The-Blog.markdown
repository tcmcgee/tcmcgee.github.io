# Recap 

I apoligize to any *frequent* readers that I havent been blogging much lately, but to catch you up on my activities. Over the
last couple of weeks I finished up my C# TicTacToe by extracting the core mechanics into a new repository and making that into a NuGet
package; I then used the NuGet package with my UI components to play the game! After that I was hoping to start my Java Server, (A stable in any 8th Light Apprenticeship)
and I did! Well... sort of, my mentors told me I would be doing an HTTP Server, but it would be in Swift. Before starting I wasn't a huge fan of swift, but it's began to grow on me,
so far I've managed to pass a few cob spec tests, and think it should go pretty well from here on out. Basically, that's all that's been going on the past month or so.

# Blog

I don't consider myself the best writer, and it's definitely an area that I would like to work on. I think the only way to get better is to blog,
starting today I plan on aiming for four blogs a week to get in the habit of writing a blog a day, and work on my writing skills. One of the hurdles
I faced was dealing with an overall lack of content, since nothing I do is exciting enough by my standars to justify a blog, but that's not stopping me anymore!
Prepare yourself for my day to day activities and bits of knowledge gained along the way. Who knows, this might even end up being a good reference for me if I forget things.
Thanks for tuning in.
