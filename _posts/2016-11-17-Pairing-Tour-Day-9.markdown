# Pairing Tour Day 9

I went into my pairing tour day with absolutely no idea what I was going to be working on. Today I was pairing with Mike Ebert, he's part of the operations team here at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com). All I knew was that I didn't need to dress up, but Mike always keeps a collared shirt at the office, just in case. Subsequently I decided to wear a collared shirt today as well, *just in case*. When I arrived the start of the day was spent checking emails that seemed to flood in every couple of minutes, after that we had a quick 'sync' (the term normally used when someone on operations gets information about how things are going at a client) with one of the clients that my pairing tour will continue on next week. Immediately after that we began looking at a proposal we're giving to a prospective client tomorrow about how they could move off of a 3rd party application to their old legacy software (which we would revamp), or onto a completely new freshly built application by 8th Light themselves. After we think we had that proposal fleshed out pretty well, we had to hop onto another call with Margaret, the sales director here at 8th light, where we talked about some changes at a different client. It was pretty cool to see this other side of the company (the side that isn't busy writing software all day). In the afternoon we fleshed out that proposal a little bit more before reviewing it with another Crafter, Myles, who is going to be working on it along with Mike. Then we were preparing for a 3:30 meeting about a 'discovery', this is basically when we look at a clients development team and see if there's any pain points that can be solved by a change in process, or some other things. I was given a zip file of probably 50 transcripts of interviews from this discovery, so when 3:30 came around and the meeting was set to begin I felt fairly knowledgeable about the general problems people think there are in the organization. It was incredibly interesting to sit in on this meeting and I hope down the line I'm presented with more, similar opportunities. Tomorrow I'm going to be pairing with my mentor Taka, on the same client I worked with Rob M. on this Monday, and Eric last Monday! In the afternoon I will also listen to a review board talk and try to 'set the stage' for mine.
