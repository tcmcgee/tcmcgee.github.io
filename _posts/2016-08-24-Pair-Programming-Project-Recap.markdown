# Pair Programming

If you've been keeping up with my blog you know that I have been working on a tic tac toe application. If you want to check that out, you can play it [here](http://beccanelson.is/tttaas-js). This project was a first in my apprenticeship because I had to work with another apprentice for the entire duration of it, pair programming for the entirety of it.

This was a huge learning experience for me and I think developed non-technical skills most similar to the ones I will need once my apprenticeship is over. There are a couple of huge takeaways from the project and I'm just going to go through them one at a time.

Previously I've done every project during my apprenticeship individually, which led to me having complete control over every aspect of the project. Pairing changed a lot of things, we had to agree on what we wanted our API to look like, we had to agree on what (if any) design patterns we wanted to use, we had to both try and make decisions to shape the project into what we thought *our* mentors would expect the project to look like when it is complete. There was just a lot of compromise and different ideas being thrown around. It added a whole new element when you thought something might need to change, having to defend why you think it could change, and a lot of the time you realized it wasn't as good of an idea as you thought.

Another large component to a pair project is communication with your pair. I had some semblance to this with my mentors, since I do try to keep them in the loop as much as I can, but it's different with a pair. It's not especially relevant to my mentors if my train is running 20 minutes late or if I accidently sleep through my alarm and am going to be a little late, but those things are definitely relevant to someone you work with all day and who expects you to be there and ready to go. Overcommunication is something that I think I need to work on, and this project helped me to develop doing that better than I had before.

The final difference that I really wasn't expecting is that you have to learn to be okay with different. I'm not OCD by any standards, but sometimes you just get so used to doing something 'your' way that when someone does things differently it irks you. For example it could be a different editor plugin that serves the same purpose, a different git workflow than you're used to, or even just using curl instead of postman. These things are small, but just something I wasn't expecting to notice.

Overall, I think this pairing project was invaluable to my development towards becoming a software crafter. My next project is TBD, but I know I'll utilize these lessons I have learned.
