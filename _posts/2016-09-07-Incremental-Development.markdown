# Development Processes

## What?

In the world of development there's a ton of different paradigms regarding how the entire development process should look, the two most commonly referenced are waterfall and agile. Waterfall development is like a waterfall filling up a row of buckets, the second bucket doesn't get filled until the first bucket is overflowing, or in this case completed. The five standard 'buckets' for a waterfall project are: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. You can imagine what each of these look like, as their names are self explanitory. This process is generally used by larger companies who are going to send thousands of employees to work on hundreds of different parts of their application, and it works... *sometimes*. The next process is called agile development and consists of continually and gradually releasing features in iterations. At the end of each (usually) two week iteration, or sprint, the application should be usuable, and ready to start from square one with new stories or tasks. From a developers standpoint I prefer agile with continuous releases and deployment.

## Why?

The answer is pretty simple, it's nice to know that things work. Using waterfall you need people very experienced with the language to create the specifications and design, and then you kind of just need to count on everything meshing how you intended. With iterations, you're able to use relatively new technology since you'll get an idea for if it's the right decision during your first iteration. You can prioritize features based on customer feedback, because your simply able to update your product after every iteration. You don't have to keep someone around because they've already read through and learned the 2000 pages of specs, and the cost of replacing them is too high. It's simpler and just makes more sense, especially when you're the team is smaller. Arguably the biggest impact on your product is the extensive tests you have. When you realease a large product you can definitely have tests, but when there's hundreds of bugs it's difficult to catch them all and write a test that replicates it. If you're doing iterations and small development cycles, you're able to fix the five or so bugs and write tests for them easily and then when it comes time for a large refactoring you can rest easy knowing you didn't backtrack.
