# Open Source

After listening to some talks, podcasts, and reading [Software Craftsmanship by Pete McBreen](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Imperative-Pete-McBreen/dp/0201733862), the importance of open source is really starting to resonate with me. For any of you who may not know open source software is software with it's source code *open*, that basically entails everyone being able to read it. Naturally if people utilize your open source software, they're probably going to have a few ideas about changes that could be made and hopefully they'll implement them, and create a pull request. This process seems simple (because it is) and is the core of the open source community.

Now that you know what it is, you're probably wondering how it relates to Craftsmanship in my opinion. I think there's two big parts of open source: Contributing to an open source project, and making your project open source / maintaining an open source project. Both of these represent good craftsmanship in their own ways.

### Contributing to a Project

Contributing to an open source project really embodies a ton of aspects of Craftsmanship. A couple of the large ways are keeping up with continuous learning, shaping the tools you use and demonstrating expertise and getting your name out there an especially important one at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com).

Continuous learning is arguably one of the most important parts of being a crafter, and something that I like isn't embodied by the current way education works in the United States. Going to school is emphasized as a 'thing you have to do' to 'get your degree' so you 'know everything you need to'. A good crafter never stops learning, and never 'knows everything they need to'. This relates to contributing to open source because there's probably a maintainer of that code who knows more than you, and as an apprentice to their crafter you can almost definitely learn something from them even if it is very domain specific. One of the qualities a crafter and an open source contributor share is that they should be humble, not afraid to be told that they're wrong, corrected, and seek clarification about what they could do better next time.


Shaping the tools you use is one of the most clear benefits of open source. Basically, you just have something you wish this library did and you go ahead and implement it yourself! The benefits of this are pretty immediate and apparent with the added benefit of contributing to a community with other people who may need this feature and having someone look over your code.

Getting your name out there, at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) we're seen as experts in a lot of fields, and the more a crafter contributes the more broadly we're known and the more likely we're to be contacted about consulting. Even outside of 8th Light many companies see open source software as a *resume*, seeing how you actually work and what your code looks like instead of whether or not you can whiteboard an implementation of quicksort in less than 20 minutes.


### Creating/Maintaining a Project

Besides creating and maintaining a project being a prestigious position, there's a number of other great benefits. If you read my blog about *signing your code*, you know that a crafter takes ownership of their projects. Making your code open source is the ultimate form of ownership, since you open every method, test, and design decision to the Internet of Critics (IoC). This code signing and openness show that a crafter takes pride in their work, are humble enough to have it critiqued, and are ready to help someone less experienced make a meaningful contribution and hopefully learn something new.

It's clear that the Open Source community is one fit for any crafter, and I think it would a really interesting exercise as an apprentice to maybe make one of my stories to create a pull request on a open source project.
