# Presentations

Throughout my apprenticeship I've given several presentations, from a quick summary
of the _The Four Rules Of Simple Design_, to a quick summary of how neural networks work,
leading into several live coding demonstrations and katas. The truth is, I wasn't exactly excited for each and every one.
The preparation for these talks combined with the anxiety of giving a technical talk to an audience who probably knows more about you do than your own topic, left some room for discomfort. The truth is that sadly things aren't always comfortable and a lot of the time I find the most important things are exactly the opposite, especially when you're getting started. I find that each and every one of my Presentations has developed my skill in several areas. First and foremost the *skill* of giving presentations, I say *skill* because researching a topic and deciding what aspects are important, combined with simplifying them enough to teach them in what is most likely about a 30 minute period.

Most people don't enjoy presentations because you have to get up in front of people and make yourself vulnerable. I have found that personally getting on the stage and making yourself vulnerable is one of the best ways to learn. Exposing *all* of your knowledge on one specific topic is an easy way to fill any gaps in knowledge that you may have, and fill in a lot of gaps for the people around you. Giving presentations really fits into what I think it means to work at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com), since such a huge emphasis is placed on continual learning for Crafters, and teaching others through the apprenticeship program giving a talk about a topic you're familiar with seems to be an incredible way to do both of those things, while sharing 8th Light's and your own ideals with the community. If I had to give one piece of advice to anyone who doesn't want to give a talk, it would have to be: Just schedule one. Once you've made the commitment you'll do the research and by the time you have to actually deliver it you will have more knowledge than you know. You'll be confident enough to tell people, "I don't know about that, but tell me more" when they know more about something, or have a question about an area you haven't researched. One of the last and most important things delivering my small talks has changed is that I'm getting to explore areas of expertise that I never could have imagined, and am finding interests in places I have never thought to look. So I'll say it one more time, **just give a talk**!
