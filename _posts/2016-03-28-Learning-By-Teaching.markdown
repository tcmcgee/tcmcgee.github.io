# Teaching 

Over the weekend one of my friends asked me if I had my own website, when I told him I did he told me he had been playing with
some HTML and CSS recently and thought all of it was really interesting. He had a local build that he had been working on while
following along with a tutorial. I insisted that he make a github account and he could host his 'website' for *FREE* using github pages.
After some initial reluctance he agreed; He had never used github before, and was also unfamiliar with the command line. After walking him
through the process of creating a github repository, and how to push what he had done locally to it his website was up and running!
During the process of teaching him the usual git workflow (add, commit, push, etc) I found him asking questions that I hadn't 
thought about since I originally started using git. For example: why do you need '-m' after commit but before the message?,
why do you need a message anyways?, What's the point of Github? All of these questions really had me thinking about things that,
although are important seemed to fall back into the back of my mind, filed under the *this is just the way things are department.*
Revisiting the basics and eventually diving into topics like cloning, how he would go about contributing to an Open Source project 
(forking, merging, issues, and pull requests), and even dealing with merge conflicts, I found myself much more confident in the topics
simply from explaining them at their most fundamental levels. All of the review came with the added bonus of teaching a friend something
I really enjoy and watching him grasp the concepts. I see why good teachers love their jobs so much, and hope to continue sharing my (admittedly small) 
knowledge base with them. Who knows, maybe I'll even get a Waza project going for this week!
