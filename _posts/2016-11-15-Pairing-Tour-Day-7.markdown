# Pairing Tour Day 7

For the 7th day of my pairing tour I was back in Libertyville pairing with Aaron. I was *lucky* (?) enough to catch Aaron on the first day of a completely new project. We had a standup in the morning where the client talked about some changes they wanted in a story, and then we set out to get the project completely set up. This project is completely in the .Net ecosystem so I was somewhat familiar, and able to help out with creating a local NuGet feed. The rest of our day was spent creating a batch (.bat) file, that would run all one of our test(s), and then proceed to generate a NuGet package. This will make our job a whole lot easier once the client tells us how CI is going to work. The repository is private and the client has no projects currently on CI so we may not end up with any CI at all. The one big thing I learned from today was I should probably familiarize myself with development on a windows machine so I can hit the ground running if I ever end up on a C# .Net project and am forced to concede to the virtual machine. I'm pairing with Aaron again tomorrow, but this time in Chicago. Can't wait to tell you all what tomorrow has in store.
