# Criticism

 **TLDR:** Avoid criticism in almost every situation in and outside of consulting.

 Part of my daily routine is going for a run and while I'm running listening to audiobooks.
 Just this week I started 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' By Dale Carnegie, and
 although the books title is kind of vain, in the first couple of chapters there's already been a ton of blog-worthy knowledge.
 One of the biggest points emphasized is how useless criticism is, and how hurtful it can be to relationships between people.
 Before I talk about this anymore let me preface that as a developer I think criticism can be useful, in *maybe* a retrospective and only in reference to code. A lot of people have a hard time separating their code from themselves but that's a topic for a different blog.

## Why You Shouldn't Criticize

Basically criticism just makes people feel bad and you potentially ruin your future relationships with them by putting yourself on a pedestal. It makes it seem like you think you're better than them (even if you do), which is generally not very tasteful. There's really not too many ways to iterate criticism makes people feel bad, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I'm going to offer some helpful alternatives.

The first alternative is to give some helpful advice. A great example of this is when I was working on a TicTacToe application in Swift,
 I ended up having my GameViewController with 8 or more responsibilities, instead of Eric (my mentor) tearing into me about how miserable my design was and how obviously it broke the single responsibility principle, he said "Hey checkout this pattern that I think could really clean this up and get your concerns separated". This way of stating things not only clarified that my concerns were not separated but also gave a helpful way for me to learn a cool new pattern and greatly improve my code.

Another alternative, especially if you don't have helpful advice to give, is just to say nothing at all. It wouldn't help anyone if I went up to another apprentice working on their Java Server, looked over their shoulder and said, "Wow, you're really doing it like *THAT*?". Although it is sometimes tempting to talk about how smoothly a project went for you in a taunting sort of way, it really helps no one and speaks a lot about insecurities you might have.

I know this blog may not have been the most technically informative, but if you're interested (even a little bit) in what I said,
read *How To Win Friends and Influence People*, you won't regret it.
