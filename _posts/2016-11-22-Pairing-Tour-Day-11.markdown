# Pairing Tour Day 11

Today marks the final day of my pairing tour! I worked with Elizabeth again on a rails project. Today was also the start of a new sprint so we had a 10:00 AM 'developer meeting', the regular 10:45 AM standup, followed by a story estimation meeting at 11:00. Luckily before all of these meetings we were able to complete a couple of one point stories involving masking an entered social security number, resulting in a decent stopping point for all of these meetings!


I had sat in on an IPM in the past with Taka and his client team, but I was fairly familiar with the team and generally how things worked. Seeing a completely new team (some of which work from Argentina), estimate was interesting. One thing I really liked about the way Elizabeths team estimated was there was no one from 'upper-management' for lack of a better term, that was there to pressure them into under estimating because of a deadline, etc. It seemed like it was genuinely an open discussion where anyone could state their opinion in regard to a specific story and would be heard. Even though these were *meetings* I was sitting in I thought they were pretty interesting, maybe that was just the fact that I didn't really have to remember anything they were saying since this was my last day with the team! I would much rather have been writing code (like always), but if there's one thing my pairing tour has emphasized for me it's working at 8th Light involves so much more than writing code all day. Whether it be intermittent meetings, hopping into a quick call to flesh out the details of a new feature, a *6 hour* long IPM, or simply being blocked by another developer on another story, these things can sometimes be a pain but it's part of the job.

In the afternoon Elizabeth had to attend an 8th Light meeting, but I was able to sit in on the 'Scrum of Scrums' with another member of Elizabeth's team. Once that was over, we were officially done with meetings for the day! With our remaining couple of hours we worked on some fresh stories.

My pairing tour was probably one of my favorite parts of my apprenticeship, from getting to see studio apps from 2011, reading .net documentation for almost a whole day, and getting to see how different teams function, I would argue it was one of the most valuable parts as well.
