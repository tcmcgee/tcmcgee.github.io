Now that my TicTacToe engine is finally finished, and being used as a gem for my tictactoe game run straight out of console, I was assigned the task to develop a web app. When I started my TicTacToe it was the first time I had ever used ruby, and it came back to bite me since I wasn't familiar at all with proper syntax or style. Since I'm learning something I have no experience in, I decide it would be best to avoid just jumping in and instead warm myself up to it a little. Hopefully my behavior will save me time in the end, but regardless it gives me some liberties to explore something new.
