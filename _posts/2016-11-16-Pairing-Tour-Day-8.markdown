# Pairing Tour Day 8

For the 8th day of my pairing tour I was back in Chicago pairing Aaron again, he had to come to the Chicago office today because of his annual review but I like to think we were both content with the commute since we were able to play ping-pong towards the end of the day. The day started with us looking at documentation on Google custom site search, we basically found all the caveats to include and exclude articles with a simple HTML meta tag and started adding the required files to a directory we made for each of the ten clients websites. Once we had a 'bare bones' skeleton of all the config files we needed we made a PR and started looking at the best way to actually add the files to the corresponding google custom site search. This ended up being quite the rabbit hole as we found several methods that functioned as we inteneded but were no longer supported, a couple of ways that just didnt work at all and a whole lot of vague documentation that helped only to distract us from things that may have actually helped. It was an interesting experience getting ramped up on a new client with Aaron these past two days and I officially know more about google site search than I will probably ever need to! Tomorrow I'm pairing with Mike E. who fills more of a director role than the stereotypical crafter, so that should be interesting! Be sure to check back tomorrow to see how it went!
