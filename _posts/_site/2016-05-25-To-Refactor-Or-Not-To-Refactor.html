<h1 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h1>

<p>Right now I’m working on an HTTP Server written in Swift. Aside from the initial connecting and reading the request, it has 
been a pretty straight forward project. There’s one situation in particular that stands out to me as an example of code that
might need to be refactored but might be fine the way it is.</p>

<h1 id="building-an-http-response">Building an HTTP Response</h1>

<p>After I read the HTTP Request, and parse it accordingly using the request method (GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, etc.) I’m able
determine whether or not it’s a valid request for my server, and if it is does perform a corresponding action.
In the HTTP Response my server will eventually send back, there’s a status code, response headers and a response body.
Since the status code, and headers are variable depending on the requests body, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getRequestBody()</code> is called first and sets the statusCode and headers for the body.
This way of doing things is far from ideal, since <code class="highlighter-rouge">getResponseBody()</code> ends up with side effects (internal variables that are changed, but not the value returned).
I have a mini review board on Friday, where I will hopefully receive some feedback about this particular section of my code but in the mean time, I’ve come up with a few work arounds.</p>

<h1 id="work-arounds">Work Arounds</h1>

<p>The best answer I can think of to the problem is having one function, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">BuildResponse()</code> that either performs all of the actions required and then returns the complete Response object, with one method call. I think I will probably try to do this before my Mini Review Board on Friday.</p>
