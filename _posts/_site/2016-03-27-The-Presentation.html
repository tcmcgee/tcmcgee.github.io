<h1 id="presentation">Presentation</h1>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was assigned to read a book and give a presentation about the contents. This book was <em>Understanding The Four Rules Of Simple Design</em>.
Due to sickness, traveling for client work, etc. my mentors haven’t been available till this coming Wednesday. I wish I could say I have been using all this time
to prepare, but sadly I never find myself with much free time. I have the powerpoint made, I’ve practiced a few times, but every time I want to call my other stories
done I think about one more thing I can change. I know <em>The Clean Coder</em> talks a lot about how important it is for a team to define ‘done’,
and I don’t think I have my definition yet. Technically the stories are implemented, but when I drag something from the ‘Working’ to ‘Completed’ column of Artisan
I want it to essentialy be out of mind until the IPM. Anyways I think I should probably put a lot of my time this next week into the presentation
since it’s the only story that’s quality will improve drastically and set the tone for the whole meeting. I’m thinking about recording myself practicing the presentation and uploading it to youtube.
At least then I’ll have a pretty good idea of how long it currently takes to present (if I take 80% of the time on my own it account for talking at lightning speed during any presentation.)
I’ll blog about how it goes most likely, so stay tuned!</p>
