<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>

<p>In <em>The Clean Coder</em>, Bob Martin talks about practice and software. Some think these words are independent of each other since ultimately the purpose of software is to deliver a product or demonstrate a principle, but in reality they’re more related than you’d expect. One might argue the purpose of a concert is to deliver music, yet you still find a musician practicing their scales for hours a day. Practice music isn’t about the concert, it’s about developing the musician; In the same sense practing software isn’t about the program being written but developing good habits in the programmer. When I read a similar metaphor in <em>The Clean Coder</em> it clarified the point for me. In the book after explaining the importance of practice, he proceeds to talk about The Coding Dojo, and a Kata.</p>

<p>When I was younger, around 5 or 6, nothing and I mean <strong>NOTHING</strong> was cooler than the Power Rangers; Watching them flip, kick and beat down on some aliens before climbing inside their massive robot and finishing them off. Naturally this led to me enrolling in a Shotokan Karate class that met in the evenings at a local elementary school. In order to acheive my dream of becoming a Power Ranger, and my moms dream of getting me off the couch, I knew I was going to have to put in a little work. The first task was a Kata, a sequence of skills I had learned in class that I needed to memorize and perform, and if the judges I performed it in front of scored it high enogh, I would get a new belt. Coincidentally, one of the first things I’m doing during my apprenticeship at 8th Light is recording my performance of a kata. Although I don’t have to get sweaty, the kata I performed at 5 and the kata I’m recording today have a lot in common. They are both meant to ‘hard code’ a pattern into your brain: the karate a valuable combination of fundamentals and the programming the basic pattern of Red Green Refactoring. When performing a kata it isn’t about learning the skills or even using your mind to solve the problem at hand, you should have practiced enough that it’s become second nature. The kata I performed is called the Bowling Game and is a simple demonstration of test first programming, and TDD. I still have a lot of practice before it’s perfect, but even just performing a kata once a day as a warm up is enough to instill good lessons.</p>

<p>Update: I never became a Power Ranger (yet), and have not participated in Karate since the performance of my first Kata. Hopefully this goes better for me.</p>
