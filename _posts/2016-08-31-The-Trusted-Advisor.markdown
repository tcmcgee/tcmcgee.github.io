# The Trusted Advisor

Everyday at 8th Light we have a daily Zagaku for apprentices, and in these Zagakus a Software Crafter will talk about something (usually technical) that they think will help the apprentices.

Yesterday's Zagaku happened to be about consulting and trust, and more specifically different types of relationships we can have as consultants. In the Zagaku Mike, the Crafter delivering the Zagaku, talked a lot about [The Trusted Advisor by David Maister](https://www.amazon.com/Trusted-Advisor-David-H-Maister/dp/0743212347) and it acted as a reference for most of his material. Now this blog is sort of a summary of some things I learned yesterday, and half a reminder for me to read this book. I had definitely heard of this book mentioned a couple of times around the office but didn't really understand what it was about. It turns out it's pretty straight forward and covers consulting in general, one of the skills I have been trying to develop the most since I started my apprenticeship in March. Enough of my motivations for this blog, lets dig in.


Mike's Zagaku specifically covered 4 different 'levels' of us as consultants in an organization and gave some examples for each.

The first level is Service, this is basically summarized as a client asking a consultant to come in and knows exactly what needs to be done, just needs a little more manpower, doesn't want to onboard a new employee, or knows that your expertice will shape the project in a better way.

The second level is Needs, I think Mike referred to this as knowing what needs to be done, being trusted enough to figure out how it should be done, but keeping them updated every step of the way with every decision you make. Now frequent updates are a super important at any level of consulting, but at this level emphasis is still on telling a tech lead exactly what you did, and exactly how it was implemented.

The third level is Relationship or the 'brain surgeon', this is someone who you know well enough and has delivered for you many times before. Instead of worrying about how they do it, it's more of a focus on get it done. They know you'll do things the right way. In my mind this is the guy on Pawn Stars telling a customer, "Oh yeah, let me call my guy." This doesn't mean to go no contact, but you should have a little more leeway.

The fourth and final level is The Trusted Advisor. Once you're here you're an integral part of the team (if you weren't already), and the CTO, tech lead, or someone will ask your input about every decision being made. This can go as far as you conducting interviews during the hiring process, filling in as interim CTO, or potentially even giving performance reviews to other members of their team. This is what every consultant strives towards, but it should never be expected. Some clients simply aren't willing to open up and won't let you break through that first or second level. 

I thought Mike's Zagaku was really interesting especially since it was less technically oriented than a lot of the other Zagakus we have. I would like to take this conclusion to write a disclaimer: I haven't read the book yet, and a lot of the things I said were paraphrasing.
