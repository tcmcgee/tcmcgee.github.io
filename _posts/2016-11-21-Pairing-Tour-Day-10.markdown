# Pairing Tour Day 10

Today marked the 10th day of my pairing tour and the beginning of the 3rd and final week.
I spent the day with Elizabeth working on a client who I was totally unfamiliar with.
The project ended up being a rails project, which I was intrigued by. My experience with rails is fairly minimal, so every chance I get to see how a project is structured I try to 'take it in' as much as I can. My rails first impression is that it's pretty different from basically everything else I've ever seen and generally don't like how closely it ties implementation in the code to the actual database schema, and how difficult it seems to be to draw the line between the two, but that's a blog for another time. Elizabeth's team was just wrapping up an iteration so most of our day was spent reviewing code, and having some of her outstanding pull requests looked over, we ended up making a lot of changes and trying to replicate a lot of specific scenarios in the project in order to approve other peoples pull requests, this resulted in climbing down some rabbit holes, and after many attempts, eventually accepting something was wrong with our local environment then leaving that specific pull request for the rest of the team to review. After a brief iteration planning meeting we continued to review code for most of the afternoon before pulling a one point story from the iteration that starts tomorrow and cranking that out. Tomorrow we should be working mostly on new stories of our own so I will probably have more to report!
