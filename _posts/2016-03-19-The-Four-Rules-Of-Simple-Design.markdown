# The Four Rules Of Simple Design

1. Passes all tests
2. Expresses every idea we need to express. (clarity)
3. Contains no duplication of knowledge
4. Make it small

These rules may *seem* simple, and quite frankly it's because they are. The point of these rules is to be general enough to be applicable in every piece of code you write, while being specific enough to be helpful to programmers of any level. The easiest way to think of these rules is as a checklist. After writing any amount of code conciously and purposefully go through each rule, and see if there's anyplace you can improve. The order of these rules does matter! Tests passing and the software working as intended is the most important part of any program, followed by the cleanliness of the code and leaving it understandable for any future developers. Now some people argue two and three are interchangeable, or in some cases three is more important than two. Personally I feel the above order is correct and nothing is more important than keeping your code legible.
