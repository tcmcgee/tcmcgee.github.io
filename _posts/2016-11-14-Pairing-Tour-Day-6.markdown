# Pairing Tour Day 6

For the 6th day of my pairing tour I was pairing with Rob M. Rob is a member of the same team working on the client I spent most of my time previously working with so I was quickly able to get up to speed on exactly what he was working on. We started the morning reviewing some pull requests by other members of the team and looking for any obvious flaws in the code, whether it be the logic or the formatting. Rob and I found a couple of issues in the readability in some places and logic in others. It turns out reviewing code is a lot more interesting when you're more familiar with the code base and the syntax of the language, but that shouldn't really be a surprise to anyone.


The team Rob worked on decided to work at a hip happening coffeeshop for the day, so after a fancy breakfast, lunch, and a story we were being blocked by being completed we were ready to grab one of our own. We quickly realized that a feature we were manually testing wasn't behaving as we had expected and we found out it was because we were looking for a UID in the wrong database! We ended up diving into some C# code and actually grabbing the right thing from the database and it behaved exactly how we expected! We spent the rest of the afternoon removing a template that contained a simple html `<li>` and replacing it with a custom view, because we needed to add some custom functionality when it is clicked. As the day was drawing to a close, we went to grab some ramen, and it was pretty delicious.
