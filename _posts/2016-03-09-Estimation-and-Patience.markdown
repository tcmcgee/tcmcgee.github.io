# Estimation

Monday was my first day at 8th Light and I was assigned my firsts two stories as a Resident Apprentice, naturally it's *another* Tic Tac Toe, this time in C#! As much as I can pretend to dread writing Tic Tac Toe again, it's proven to be a great way to freshen up on the language, learn new syntax, and practice good design and TDD. I've been trying to take some of the feedback I received during my application process, and apply it to the first iteration of Tic Tac Toe. So far it's going well, I'll talk about that more in the patience section. Anyways when assigned the stories, my mentor had me go through each one giving an estimation of how long they would take me. A optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic guess for each story. It's pretty safe to say I had absolutely no idea how to estimate the difficulty of the tasks. It wasn't like school where something was 'due' on a certain date, it was a completely unique idea where I had to try to account for my workflow, possible problems, and taking my time to write the cleanest code I could. Since I had created several tic tac toe games in the past I was inclined to lean towards lower estimates, since algorithmically I had a good idea of how the game worked. I think that skill can only come with time, and since I estimate every story I work on during my residency, I will get plenty of practice.

# Patience

Another thing I've always had a lot of trouble with when programming, specifically TDD, is patience. In every program I have worked on so far there comes a point where I have to write the first test for the next feature, and there just doesn't seem to be an easy way to test it. The obvious answer is to refactor, but still I find the lone wolf, anti-testing, hacker in me trying to dive straight into the code and figure out that whole testing thing later. This is something I definitely want to work on, and have been stressing in this newest Tic Tac Toe.

Since this is my first blog, I decided to blog about things I want to imporve at. Soon I will look back and see if I've shown any improvements.
