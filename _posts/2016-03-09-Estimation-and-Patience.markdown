# Estimation

Monday was my first day at 8th Light and I was assigned my firsts two stories as a Resident Apprentice, naturally it's *another* Tic Tac Toe! (This time in C#) As much as I can pretend to dread making another one, and hop on the TTT bandwagon it's proven to be a great way to freshen up on the language, learn new syntax, and practice good design and TDD. I've been trying to take some of the feedback I received during my application process, and _apply_ it to the first iteration of Tic Tac Toe. So far it's going alright, I'll talk about that more in the patience section. Anyways when assigned the stories, my mentor had me go through each one giving an estimation of how long each one would take me. An optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic guess. It's pretty safe to say I had absolutely no idea how long the tasks would take me. It wasn't like school where something was 'due' on a certain date, it was a completely unique idea where I had to try to account for my workflow, possible problems, and taking my time to write the cleanest code I could. I think that skill can only come with time, and since I estimate every story I should get plenty of practice.

# Patience

Another thing I've always had a lot of trouble with when programming, specifically TDD, is patience. In every program I have written so far there comes a point where I have to write the first test for the next feature I'm adding, and there just doesn't seem to be an easy way to test it. The obvious answer is to refactor, but still I find the Lone Wolf Late Night Hacker (LWLNH) in me trying to dive into the next feature and figure out that whole testing thing later. This is something I definitely want to work on, and have been stressing in this newest Tic Tac Toe.

Since this is my first blog and all, I decided to blog about things I want to imporve at. Hopefully some day soon I'll be able to look back and know I'm much better at both of these!
