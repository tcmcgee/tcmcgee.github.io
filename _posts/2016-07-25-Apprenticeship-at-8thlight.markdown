# 8th Light
After reading through my past bunch of blogs I've come to realize that I haven't actually talked much about my apprenticeship.
I'm a resident apprentice at a software consulting company, [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) which offers software development services all around the world. The employees I work with and watch everyday are some of the hardest working people, and compared to other software developers I've met hold themselves to a much higher standard.

# Apprenticeship
Every employee at 8th Light has gone through some sort of apprenticeship, whether it be a 3 month journeyman apprenticeship or a 6-9 month resident apprenticeship every crafter has done it. An apprenticeship consists of a lot of things, and everything you do is preparation to write great software and work well in a team. You spend a lot of time writing code, cleaning it up, reading, and hopefully blogging. Before I started here I would crank out homework assignments 1-2 hours before they were due and then forget the code was ever written, but at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) they value a lot more than _making it work_ and put an emphasis on good design and the ability to simply add a new feature. I've sure I've already learned more in my 5 months here than I had in all of school. If you think 8th Light might be a good fit for you, you should check out the [apprenticeship program](https://8thlight.com/apprenticeship/) and get ready to learn a lot!
