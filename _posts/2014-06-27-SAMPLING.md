title: Trying my Hand at Sampling
---

Today I found an <a href= "http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">interesting article</a> about visualizing algorithms, there were 3 specifically mentioned, sampling, sorting and maze-building, but only sampling really stood out to me, as visualizing sorting algorithms is something you can find almost anywhere, and maze making just didn't seem useful, aside from learning the fundamental process behind it. So using some of my IU libraries and Scheme, I was able to produce a very simple sampling algorithm of my own! Although I didn't implement the more advanced algorithms displayed, or completely fill in the image with no white space I think my method works effectively. You can see my code below!

{% highlight scheme %}
#lang racket

(require c211-libs/fast-image)
(require c211-libs/matrix)


(define img-manip
  (lambda(samples)
    (let ((img (read-image)))
      (let ((rows (image-rows img)))
        (let ((cols (image-cols img)))
          (draw-image (recure img rows cols (make-image rows cols (lambda (r c)
                                                                    (color 255 255 255))) samples))
          )))))
(define recure
  (lambda (img rows cols img2 samples)
    (let ((x (random rows)))
      (let ((y (random cols)))
        (let ((drawx (/ samples rows)))
          (let ((drawy (/ samples cols)))
            (cond
              [(zero? samples) img2]
              [else
               (let ((c1 (image-ref img x y)))
                 (for ([i (in-range drawx)])
                   (for ([j (in-range drawy)])
                     (cond
                       [(and ( > i  -1)  ( < i  cols)  (> j  -1)  (< j rows)) (image-set! img2 (+ x i) (+ y j ) c1)]
                       [else 0]
                       ))))(recure img rows cols img2 (- samples 1))])))))))


{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the code selects a random x and y coordinate, and recursively calls the conviently named 'recurse' method until samples is 0, and because of this samples number I was able to utilize it's decreasing value by having a direct correlation to the amount of pixels drawn compared to the number of samples remaining. I initially thought this might not be the best idea but after thinking about it, the first samples will color a large area of the image, and as it got closer and closer to finishing the detail would become more and more fine. This method only works because of the randomness of the points selected, allowing a similar location to be colored several times may not be the most efficent but it provides for a better accuracy and leaves less of the image uncolored. I have several examples, first my own face!!

Not too shabby if you ask me! I believe that was with 1000 samples, but it was also a smaller image.<br><br>
Next I went for the recreation of the blog's Starry Night!

It's getting there! Although I did use 30,000 samples... All in all it was a fun experience and a great break from TicTacToe. I hope to come back and optimize this some day soon, and propagate my love for image manipulation!
