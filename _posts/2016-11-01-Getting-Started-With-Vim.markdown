# Vim

Throughout my apprenticeship at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) I have spent a fair amount of time pairing with Crafters, and one thing I noticed is everyone has a different workflow. When I talk about workflow in this context I'm primarily referring to which editor they prefer, for example, I've worked with Crafters who use Atom, Sublime, and Vim. Naturally it's important to me not to force a Crafter to upset their workflow, especially since it's already enough work bringing a pair that lacks context up to speed. As you've probably noticed this post is about Vim, you may be wondering why I'm not writing about learning Sublime or Atom, and that's because neither of those editors, or any editor I've used thus far, have a learning curve quite as steep as that of Vim.

Now there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to learning Vim, from Vim Adventures a browser based game that gets you familiar with the key binds to `Vimtutor` a shell command that comes packaged with Vim to teach you the basics.

# Beyond the basics

I have learned the basics, and consider myself good enough to not slow down someone I'm pairing with so much that they may notice. So the question is, what's next? In case you're not sure Vim is a *very* powerful and lightweight text editor, but I have personally had some issues advancing beyond, 'good enough'. This is because the key binds are exactly intuitive for a newer user. So to improve further, when there's something in your code that makes you say, "man I wish I knew a better way to do that", instead of doing it the simple way, involving deleting your message character by character with `x`, sacrifice a little time and google, "how to delete everything between parenthesis Vim" or "Copy to Mac clipboard vim", you would find things like `dt)` and `!pbcopy`. Learning Vim like a lot of things, gets worse before it gets better, but from what I have seen when working with crafters fluent, is that it gets **much much** better. So don't be afraid to sacrifice doing something *right now*, for learning how to do something a little bit quicker. Don't forget to always keep your eye on the prize too, and that is how cool you look in front of people who have to use their mouse.
