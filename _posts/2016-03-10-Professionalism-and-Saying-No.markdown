# The Clean Coder

 One of my apprentice tasks for was this week is read a book, The Clean Coder [^1]. This book talks very explicitly of what is expected of a software professional, and gives some educational examples of what *isn't* . I'm over half way through the book, and although it's catered specifically to software professionals, Uncle Bob makes a lot of points relevant to any professional. Every chapter is delivered directly with stories from his own career, or examples situations where the lesson is applicable. I really recommend everyone give it a read, I've enjoyed it immensely so far!

# Saying No

One chapter that stood out to me was all about the importance of saying no. I enjoy  making others happy as much as the next guy, and a lot of times saying no isn't the best way to do that. Sadly, it's not realistic to be a people-pleaser all the time, and definitely not when it involves delivering software to clients. There are deadlines to meet and products to ship; it doesn't do anyone favors if you agree to add a new feature to a sprint when you're not positive you'll actually be able to include it! This is where saying no comes in, sometimes there simply won't be enough time to have everything you or the client wants. Although it's difficult to potentially upset someone who is counting on you, it's better to be honest with them as soon as possible about a delay in a feature than not have it ready for a demo and put you and your company's image on the line. Even in the *best* (?) case scenario, you put in hours of overtime, sacrificing the quality of the code and your sanity to deliver a product that you're not even proud of. I promise you the next person to come along and attempt to modify it won't be too proud either.  
Moral of the story, a hard truth is a heck of a lot better than a false promise. Delivering when you say you will *consistently* will earn you respect; don't be afraid to stick with your guns when someone tries to pressure you into making a promise you cant keep. Always be a professional.
