# Apprenticeship

I am a resident apprentice at 8th Light, and for most of my apprenticeship that meant I would come in every day and work on specific apprenticeship' projects that most apprentices before me have done a variation of, and most apprentices after me probably will as well. Now that I'm closer to the end of my apprenticeship here and closer to becoming a Crafter, it makes sense that I have begun to work on client projects for the past couple of weeks in October. This has been quite a different experience than my usual schedule of arriving at the office around 8:30, and writing lines of code for the majority of the day. So today I'm going to delve into what I've deemed *The Process*, all of the things that come up when you're not working alone of a 'fixed scope' project.

# The Process

## People

Naturally people are going to be the source of a lot of delays, but they're also the reason there's anything to work on so it's tough to complain too much about this one. Instead I'm thinking more of all of the things that exist based around Human to Human interaction in Software development. Most mornings have a standup which is usually pretty brief, and is a helpful part of deciding what you as a developer will be most effective in doing that day, as well as keeping up with your team if some members of remote. It's tough to argue that standup is a vital part of keeping the team operating as one unit, as well as keeping morale high and everyone comfortable and open to discuss anything important to the team. Whether it be challenging a design decision, or asking where to meet for lunch, it's awesome when working on your team dynamic feels more like a very devoted programming club than an assigned team of developers. Most of the work you do in a day revolves around work other people are doing so it can't be stressed enough to communicate!

## Programming

Now this one may seem pretty obvious, but on a productive day during the middle of the sprint programming tends to take up a lot of the day. The misconception a lot of people (including myself) make is that being a developer, especially a consultant, you'll spend your day programming every single day. Sadly, or happily depending on how social you are, this usually is not the case from what I've seen and a nice chunk of the day goes to other stuff, or as this blog will reference it, **pleh**.

## Pleh

Pleh is everything else, whether it be slack messaging about a mission-critical bug that's blowing up production before tracking it down, or deciding on what to name an API's new endpoint with a few members of the team, Pleh is basically everything else. I'll be honest **pleh** is a lot like **people**, but you've got to draw the line somewhere so this is where it is. Pleh is usually the area that can be the most improved with better stories. For example that 30 minute conversation you may have just had about how the JSON response has different keys than you were expecting may have been avoidable with a clearer story, but that isn't always the case. Either way expect some of your day to be pleh.


When transitioning from mostly solo work to a larger team, or switching clients and getting up to speed expect a lot the 3 'P's or in this case **People, Programming, and Pleh**. My past couple of weeks on client work has been a huge learning experience to me and I look forward to learning even more moving forward!
