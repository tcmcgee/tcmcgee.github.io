# Swift

As you may or may not know, over the past month or so I have been working on an HTTP Server written in Swift. Originally the task was pretty daunting as most apprentices write their server in a language I’m much more familiar with, Java. After getting over the initial learning curve of !’s and ?’s being a part of my daily syntax, the language began to grow on me. I can now say it’s one of my favorite languages.

# But Why?

Swift, like any language, has it’s ups and downs but every time I find a down, a solution is quickly offered. For example, Swift isn’t exactly bleeding edge but it’s method names, parameters, and syntax seems to change pretty regularly. Since my project is using a toolchain (version) that isn’t yet considered stable the documentation isn’t updated. As confusing as this is, especially for someone who is just learning the language, Swift is built on top of C and supports it. A lot of times I find myself interloping my swift code with Objective-C since there’s a ton of well documented examples online and even more answers to questions, in a language that hasn’t significantly changed in a long time. Now that Swift is moving towards open source I think things are moving in a great direction and can’t wait to develop in Swift for years to come!
