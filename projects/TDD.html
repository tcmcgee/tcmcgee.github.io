<h2>8th Light And Test-Driven Development</h2>
<br>
<h2> </h2>
<h4>Over the summer of 2014 and 2015 I was an intern at 8th Light, every full-time developer there is a software craftsman. These craftsman are not only experts in Test Driven Development and Agile Methodologies, but love to code and never want to stop learning how to be better. So far two summers there has been an incredible experience for me, always having someone experienced to look over my code, pair program with, or just ask a question. I take their values to heart and am not only trying to write better code, but make sure I have proper test coverage and consider every edge case! Check out my Github account  <a href="https://www.github.com/tcmcgee"> here</a> to see some examples.</h4>
