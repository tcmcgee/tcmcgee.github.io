<h2>8th Light And Test-Driven Development</h2>
<br>
<h2> </h2>
<h4>Over the summer of 2014 and 2015 I was an intern at 8th Light, every full-time developer there is a software craftsman. These craftsman are not only experts in Test Driven Development and Agile Methodologies, but love to code and never want to stop learning how to be better. So far two summers there has been an incredible experience for me, always having someone experienced to look over my code, pair program with, or just ask a question. Where college courses encouraged the use of a single language 8th Light inspired me to find something I thought was interesting and dive in. I've completed projects from a <a href = "https://github.com/tcmcgee/JavaServer"> simple HTTP server in Java </a> tested with cob_spec to <a href = "https://github.com/tcmcgee/TicTacToeRuby/tree/master/lib"> Tic Tac Toe written in ruby,</a> with the AI using the Negamax algorithm, which was later made into an endpoint for <a href = "https://github.com/tcmcgee/JavascriptTTT"> my Javascript Tic Tac Toe AI</a>. Needless to say, I had a lot of fun last summer and believe the skills taught to me at 8th Light and the values I have been trying to apply to my programming would allow me to quickly contribute to any project, big or small.</h4>
