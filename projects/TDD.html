<h2>TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<br>
<h2> This project page will include: </h2>
<p>Me talking about my experience at 8th Light, and how they taught me to take pride in writing clean code, with full test coverage. Go back to something I did over the summer and polish it then add some code snippets or the github repo here. Look into QA automation some more, A test I made for Ruby Tic Tac Toe plays every possible game against the AI to prove it's unbeatable. I think that could be a good example of algorithms and testing. Maybe this section doesn't need to be included in the portfolio but I think a lot of employers think it's important. </p>
