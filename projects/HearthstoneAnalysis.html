<h2> HEARTHSTONE ANALYSIS </h2>
<br>
<h2> This project page will include: </h2>
<p>An in depth analysis of a certain hearthstone card or mechanic, determining how a card fits into the current Meta, or taking an underpowered card and determining how and why tweaking it in a certain way would make it better fit into the meta, and playable again. Comment on why Blizzard might now want to change a card too much, (they want to make it feel like you OWN the card much like you would a MTG/yugioh/Pokemon card) and changing what would normally be represented as a physical card on the fly abuses the players trust, especially since they could of spent real money on it. </p>
