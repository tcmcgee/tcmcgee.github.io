<h2> Student Projects </h2>
<br>
<h4> While a student at Indiana Univeristy, several of my classes called for collaboration with other students. These projects gave me valuable experience working with other students. Other students in these classes were mostly less technical than I am, so I was able to practice communicating ideas in the 'big picture' and explaining when an idea that seems simple might be out of the scope of our project or team size. Overall the experience of working on actual projects with actual deadlines and goals to meet has been invaluable.</h4>
