<h2> Student Projects </h2>
<br>
<h4> While a student at Indiana Univeristy, several of my classes called for collaboration. These projects gave me valuable experience working with other students. The students in my groups were mostly less technical than I am, so I was able to practice communicating ideas in the 'big picture' and explaining when an idea that seems simple might be out of the scope of our project or team size. Overall the experience of working on actual projects with actual deadlines and goals to meet has been invaluable.</h4>

<h4>Here's some of the games I've worked on...<br><br>

<i><b>A Shot In The Dark</b> </i> (Lead Programmer) - Two players drag, drop and rotate their own set of blocks building a base then use an Angry Birds-esque catapult must destroy each others.
<br><br>
<i><b>Posession</b> </i> (Lead Programmer) - A young girl accused of Witchcraft in Salem, must use her ability to possess the townsfolk to prove her innocence without exposing herself in the process. 
<br><br>
<i><b>Ripper</b> </i> (Programmer) - In London, Jack The Ripper is out for blood and you're the only suspect. A friend in Scotland yard trys to buy you time to solve the case before they arrest you.
<br><br>
Each game presented obstacles, for example when working on <i>A Shot In The Dark</i> I was quickly able to get the building and shooting mechanics implemented when we had alotted much more time them. This caused our group to get sidetracked, and blow the scope way out of proporition for the deadline we were given. Although their ideas were interesting, I had to tell them we didn't have time for a full featured game and explain how difficult it would of been to add something like ninjas digging a tunnel under the other players base, etc.
